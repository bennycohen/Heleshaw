# Heleshaw: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Quasi-2D Combustion Studies

## Description

Heleshaw is a specialized apparatus designed for the study of quasi-2D flames. This project is a multi-purpose toolkit aimed at data organization, simulation techniques, and enhanced understanding of combustion instabilities in Heleshaw experiments. It also includes plans for a dedicated website to host all the relevant data and information.

## Objectives

1. **Data Organization**: Create a robust database to store an extensive collection of Heleshaw videos.
2. **Data Visualization**: Assist in generating plots and graphs for better data interpretation.
3. **Model Updating**: Use collected data to improve existing combustion models.
4. **Understanding Instabilities**: Provide resources for understanding the instabilities that occur in quasi-2D combustion.
5. **Web Hosting**: Host all necessary data and information on a user-friendly website.
